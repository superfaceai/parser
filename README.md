## Background
 Superface (super-interface) is a higher-order API, an abstraction on top of the modern APIs like GraphQL and REST. Superface is one interface to discover, connect, and query any capabilities available via conventional APIs. 

 Through its focus on application-level semantics, Superface decouples the clients from servers, enabling fully autonomous evolution. As such it minimizes the code base as well as errors and downtimes while providing unmatched resiliency and redundancy. 

 Superface allows for switching capability providers without development at a runtime in milliseconds. Furthermore, Superface decentralizes the composition and aggregation, and thus creates an Autonomous Integration Mesh.

 Motivation behind Superface is nicely described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCvq3NXFb94) from APIdays conference.

## Install

To install the package, first create `.npmrc` file in your project root and put the following line into it.

```
@superfaceai:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then authenticate to github npm package registry. Use your github name as your login and generate a personal access token with at least the `read:packages` permission in Github to use as password:

```
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

After doing this, you should be able to install the package by calling:

```
yarn add @superfaceai/parser
```
## Security

Superface is not man-in-the-middle so it does not require any access to secrets that are needed to communicate with provider API. Superface CLI only prepares super.json file with authorization fields in form of environment variable. You just set correct variables and communicate directly with provider API.

You can find more information in [SDK repository](https://github.com/superfaceai/sdk-js/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Publishing a new version

Package publishing is done through GitHub release functionality.

[Draft a new release](https://github.com/superfaceai/parser/releases/new) to publish a new version of the package.

Use semver for the version tag. It must be in format of `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.

Github Actions workflow will pick up the release and publish it as one of the [packages](https://github.com/superfaceai/parser/packages).
